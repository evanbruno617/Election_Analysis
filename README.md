* Jefferson received 38,855 or 10.5% of the total votes. Denver recieved 306,055 or 82.8% of the total votes. Arapahoe received 24,801 or 6.7% of the total votes. This was calculated with a for loop by adding a vote to each county every time it showed up in a row. Using this if function [     ] allows each county to be assigned to a key and a value, votes for each county, to be associated with it. The percentage of votes was calculated by dividing it by the total votes and multplying it by 0 in an if statement. **Insert here
